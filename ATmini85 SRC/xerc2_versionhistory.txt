XERC 2 Version history
----------------------

-- = internal
++ = public

++v1.001
* Fixed the switched EB and PB pins
* Factory Reset now blinks _BLINK_VERSION_ as a three digit code, so that we can find out firmware in the "field"
* _BLINK_VERSION_ = 0

++v1.000
* First public release

--v0.919
* Rearrangement of the code and some optimizing

--v0.918
* fixed the problems caused with the xbox360 remote. This problem was caused by MS using the first bit in the information field as a toggle bit so the remote presses only worked 50% of the time. We now ignore that bit.

--v0.917
* added control for short single ir disturbance pulses that could cause the xerc to be waiting for a rising pulse when it would never get a rising pulse. This was the cause of the flicker bug in config.

--v0.916
* adjusted dim led values (slightly brigther clear and slightly brighter dim)
* push and pop Temp1 in all dim_led operations
* moved flicker start to after the ir start bit for possible better flicker

--v0.915
* fixed initial glitch on fader
* adjusted fader values
* possible fix of the remote flicker in fader

--v0.914
* added flicker on remote press when in config
* adjusted fader valuse
